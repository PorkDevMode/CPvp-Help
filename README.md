# CPvp-Help

A simple addon with simple features, if you want to improve the very basics of cpvp without wasting hours of your life this is the project.

# Features

* Click Crystal | Basically automatically clicks on crystals for you when you hover your mouse over them, makes sure your looking at the crystal with a customizable delay.
* Ez Anchor | When you place an anchor, automatically swaps to glowstone and charges the anchor, swaps to designated slot to detonate it, and swaps back to the anchor slot.

# TODO

* Make sure click crystal and ez anchor only work on crystals you placed.
* Make ez anchor only work after placing one not when hovering over one
* Make ez anchor cancel everything if your cursor is not over that anchor
* Add safe anchoring to ez anchor in a legit way
